# Messenger Platform Sample -- node.js

This project is an example server for Messenger Platform built in Node.js. With this app, you can see how to use welcome screens on Messenger.

It contains the following functionality:

* Webhook (specifically for Messenger Platform events)
* Send API 
* Web Plugins
* Messenger Platform v1.1 features

Follow the [walk-through](https://messenger.fb.com/developers/tutorials/setting-up-the-welcome-screen/) to learn about this project in more detail.

## Setup

Set the values in `config/default.json` before running the sample. Descriptions of each parameter can be found in `app.js`. Alternatively, you can set the corresponding environment variables as defined in `app.js`.

Replace values for `APP_ID` and `PAGE_ID` in `public/index.html`.

## Run

You can start the server by running `npm start`. However, the webhook must be at a public URL that the Facebook servers can reach. Therefore, running the server locally on your machine will not work.

You can run this example on a cloud service provider like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform or AWS. Note that webhooks must have a valid SSL certificate, signed by a certificate authority. Read more about setting up SSL for a [Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks#setup).

## Webhook

All webhook code is in `app.js`. It is routed to `/webhook`. This project handles callbacks for authentication, messages, delivery confirmation and postbacks. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference).
